                <h2>How to Raise Chickens</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Housing:</strong> Provide a secure, clean coop that protects chickens from predators and harsh weather. Ensure good ventilation and access to nesting boxes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Food:</strong> Chickens require a balanced diet of commercial feed, grains, and access to greens. Supplement their diet with kitchen scraps and grit for digestion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water:</strong> Fresh, clean water must be available at all times. Use waterers that prevent contamination.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Needs:</strong> Chickens are social animals and should be kept in groups. A minimum of three to six chickens is recommended.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Specific Tips for Northern MN</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best Time to Start:</strong> Start chicks indoors in late winter (February to March) for an early spring outdoor transition. This timing helps them grow before the coldest weather hits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Average Growth Time:</strong> Chickens typically reach maturity in about 20 weeks for egg-laying hens and 6 to 8 weeks for broilers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Winterizing Tips:</strong> Ensure the coop is well-insulated and draft-free. Use deep litter bedding to provide warmth and absorb moisture. Consider supplemental heating during extreme cold spells, but ensure it's safe to prevent fires.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cold-Hardy Breeds:</strong> Choose breeds that are known for their cold hardiness, such as Rhode Island Reds, Plymouth Rocks, and Orpingtons, which can withstand colder temperatures.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Health and Maintenance</h2>
                <p>Regularly check for signs of illness, parasites, and injuries. Maintain a clean coop to prevent disease, and provide access to outdoor space for foraging and exercise.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Egg Production</h2>
                <p>Egg-laying hens typically start producing eggs at around 5 to 6 months of age. The production rate varies by breed but can average 250 to 300 eggs per year per hen.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fresh Eggs:</strong> Store eggs in a cool, dry place, preferably in the refrigerator, where they can last for several weeks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Preserving Eggs:</strong> Consider preserving eggs by pickling or dehydrating them for long-term storage.</li>
