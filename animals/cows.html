                <h3>Specific Tips for Northern MN</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best Time to Start:</strong> Begin raising cows in late spring (May) when grass is plentiful and weather is mild.</li>
                    <li><strong>Average Growth Time:</strong> Calves typically reach weaning weight by 6 to 8 months and can be finished for market at around 12 to 18 months, depending on breed and management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Winterizing Tips:</strong> Ensure that shelters are insulated and wind-resistant. Provide ample bedding and consider feeding hay and grain to supplement their diet during harsh winter months.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cold-Hardy Breeds:</strong> Choose breeds that adapt well to cold climates, such as Angus, Hereford, or Holstein.</li>
                </ul>
