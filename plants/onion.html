                <h2>How to Grow Onions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Onions thrive in loose, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. A pH of 6.0 to 7.0 is ideal for onion growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water:</strong> Onions need regular watering, especially during bulb formation. Keep the soil moist but not waterlogged.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Onions prefer full sun, needing at least 6 hours of sunlight per day to grow healthy bulbs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pests and Diseases:</strong> Watch out for onion maggots, thrips, and fungal diseases like downy mildew and onion rot. Crop rotation can help reduce disease risk.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Specific Tips for Northern MN</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best Time to Plant:</strong> In northern Minnesota, plant onion sets or transplants in early spring, usually in late April or early May, once the soil is workable and frost danger has passed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Average Growth Time:</strong> Onions take about 90 to 120 days to mature, depending on the variety.</li>
                    <li><strong>Winterizing Tips:</strong> Onions are typically harvested in late summer. For overwintering onions, plant specific winter-hardy varieties in late summer or fall and cover them with mulch for insulation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Storage Tips:</strong> Cure onions by letting them dry for several weeks in a warm, well-ventilated area. Once dried, store them in a cool, dry place.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Onions are ready to harvest when the tops turn yellow and start to fall over. After pulling them from the ground, let them cure in a warm, dry, and well-ventilated area for a few weeks before storing them.</p>
