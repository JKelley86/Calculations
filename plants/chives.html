                <h2>How to Grow Chives</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Chives grow best in well-drained soil with a high organic content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> They thrive in full sun but can tolerate partial shade.</li>
                    <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist, especially during dry periods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Propagation:</strong> Chives can be grown from seeds or by dividing existing plants.</li>
                    <li><strong>Harvesting:</strong> Snip the leaves close to the ground when they reach about 6 inches tall, but leave at least 2 inches of growth for regrowth.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Specific Tips for Northern MN</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best Time to Plant:</strong> Chives can be planted in early spring after the last frost, usually around mid-to-late May in northern Minnesota.</li>
                    <li><strong>Average Growth Time:</strong> Chives typically take about 30 days to sprout and will be ready for harvest within 60 days.</li>
                    <li><strong>Winterizing Tips:</strong> Chives are hardy perennials and can survive northern Minnesota winters. Mulch the plants heavily with straw or leaves in late fall to protect the roots from freezing. In early spring, remove the mulch to allow new growth.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
