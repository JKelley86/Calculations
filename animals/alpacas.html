                <h2>How to Raise Alpacas</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Housing:</strong> Provide a clean, dry shelter that protects them from rain, wind, and extreme temperatures. Adequate ventilation is essential.</li>
                    <li><strong>Food:</strong> Alpacas are herbivores that primarily eat grass and hay, supplemented with minerals and vitamins as needed. Fresh water should always be available.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Ensure they have ample space to roam and graze, as they need regular exercise to stay healthy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Needs:</strong> Alpacas are social creatures that thrive in herds; keep at least two together to meet their social needs.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Specific Tips for Northern MN</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best Time to Start:</strong> Begin raising alpacas in late spring (May) to help them acclimate to their surroundings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Average Growth Time:</strong> Alpacas typically reach maturity around 1 year of age, though they can continue to develop until 2 years old.</li>
                    <li><strong>Winterizing Tips:</strong> Ensure that shelters are insulated and dry. Provide extra bedding and monitor for health issues during the winter months.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cold-Hardy Breeds:</strong> Alpacas can adapt to colder climates, but their housing must provide adequate protection from harsh weather.</li>
