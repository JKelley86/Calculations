                <h2>How to Grow Cucumbers</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Cucumbers prefer well-drained, fertile soil with plenty of organic matter. A pH of 6.0 to 7.0 is ideal. Work compost into the soil before planting to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Cucumbers need full sun, at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day, to produce the best yields.</li>
                    <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist. Cucumbers need regular watering, especially when fruit is forming. Mulching around the plants helps retain moisture and prevents weeds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plant Spacing:</strong> If planting bush varieties, space plants 18 to 24 inches apart. For vining varieties, space them 36 to 48 inches apart, with trellises to allow the vines to climb.</li>
                    <li><strong>Harvesting:</strong> Harvest cucumbers when they are firm, green, and the right size for the variety. Pick them often to encourage more fruit production.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Specific Tips for Northern MN</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best Time to Plant:</strong> In northern Minnesota, start seeds indoors 3 to 4 weeks before the last frost (around mid-April) and transplant seedlings outdoors in late May or early June when the soil temperature reaches 60°F or higher.</li>
                    <li><strong>Average Growth Time:</strong> Cucumbers mature in 50 to 70 days, depending on the variety.</li>
                    <li><strong>Season Extension Tips:</strong> Use black plastic mulch or row covers to warm the soil and protect plants from cooler temperatures early in the season. Growing cucumbers in raised beds also helps maintain warm soil conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>End-of-Season Tips:</strong> As fall approaches, cover cucumber plants at night to protect them from early frost. Harvest cucumbers frequently before the first hard frost occurs.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Storage Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fresh Cucumbers:</strong> Store cucumbers in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. For longer storage, they can be pickled and stored in jars for several months.</li>
                    <li><strong>Preserving:</strong> Cucumber slices or spears can be pickled in vinegar with seasonings like dill, garlic, and spices. Store pickles in the refrigerator or process them for long-term storage in a cool, dark place.</li>
