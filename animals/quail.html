                <h2>How to Raise Quail</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Housing:</strong> Quail require a clean, secure enclosure that protects them from predators and harsh weather. Ensure adequate ventilation and space for movement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Food:</strong> Feed quail a high-protein diet specifically formulated for game birds, along with grains and greens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water:</strong> Provide fresh, clean water in shallow dishes or waterers to prevent drowning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Breeding:</strong> Quail can be bred in small spaces. Males should be kept with multiple females to reduce aggression.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Specific Tips for Northern MN</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best Time to Start:</strong> Start raising quail indoors in early spring (April) when temperatures begin to warm up. This allows them to acclimate before being moved outside.</li>
                    <li><strong>Average Growth Time:</strong> Quail typically reach maturity in about 6 to 8 weeks, depending on the breed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Winterizing Tips:</strong> Ensure the enclosure is insulated and draft-free during winter. Use heat lamps if necessary to maintain warmth. Providing bedding like straw or shavings can help insulate the ground.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cold-Hardy Breeds:</strong> Choose breeds that can withstand colder temperatures, such as Coturnix quail, which are known for their hardiness.</li>
                </ul>
