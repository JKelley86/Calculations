                <h2>How to Grow Lettuce</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Lettuce prefers well-drained, rich soil with plenty of organic matter. Aim for a pH between 6.0 and 7.0.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist, but not soggy. Regular watering is crucial, especially during dry spells.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Lettuce thrives in full sun to partial shade, especially during hot summer months.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pests and Diseases:</strong> Monitor for aphids, slugs, and other pests, and take appropriate action if infestations occur.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Specific Tips for Northern MN</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best Time to Plant:</strong> Sow seeds in early spring (April) or late summer (August) for fall harvest, as lettuce grows best in cooler temperatures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Average Growth Time:</strong> Lettuce typically takes 30 to 70 days to reach maturity, depending on the variety.</li>
                    <li><strong>Winterizing Tips:</strong> In northern climates, consider growing cold-hardy varieties in late summer or using row covers to protect plants from frost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growing Indoors:</strong> Lettuce can also be grown indoors under grow lights, allowing for year-round harvesting.</li>
                </ul>
