                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Housing:</strong> Provide a dry, secure shelter that protects them from extreme weather. Ensure there is adequate ventilation and space for them to move freely.</li>
                    <li><strong>Food:</strong> Llamas primarily eat grass, hay, and grains. Fresh water should always be available, and they may also require mineral supplements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Allow llamas plenty of space to roam and graze, as they are active animals that need regular exercise.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Needs:</strong> Llamas are social animals and should ideally be kept in groups to prevent loneliness and stress.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best Time to Start:</strong> Start raising llamas in late spring (May) to ensure they acclimate well to their environment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Average Growth Time:</strong> Llamas typically reach maturity at around 2 to 3 years of age, though they may continue to grow until 4 years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Winterizing Tips:</strong> Provide insulated shelter and plenty of bedding during winter. Monitor their health closely, as cold weather can affect their well-being.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cold-Hardy Breeds:</strong> Most llamas are adaptable to colder climates, but ensure they have adequate shelter and care.</li>
