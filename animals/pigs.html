                <h2>How to Raise Pigs</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Housing:</strong> Provide a clean, dry shelter that protects pigs from extreme weather, including rain and cold. Ensure adequate ventilation and space to move around.</li>
                    <li><strong>Food:</strong> Pigs are omnivores and require a balanced diet that includes grains, fruits, vegetables, and commercially formulated feed to meet their nutritional needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Allow plenty of space for pigs to roam and root around, as exercise is crucial for their well-being.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Needs:</strong> Pigs are social animals and should be kept in groups to prevent stress and encourage natural behavior.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Specific Tips for Northern MN</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best Time to Start:</strong> Spring (April to May) is the best time to start raising pigs to allow them to adapt before harsh winter conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Average Growth Time:</strong> Pigs typically reach market weight (around 250-300 pounds) in about 5 to 6 months, depending on the breed and diet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Winterizing Tips:</strong> Ensure housing is insulated, dry, and has proper bedding to keep pigs warm during winter. Provide a heated water source to prevent freezing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cold-Hardy Breeds:</strong> Some pig breeds are more resilient to cold; choose breeds like the Berkshire or Hampshire for northern climates.</li>
