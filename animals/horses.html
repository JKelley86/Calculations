                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best Time to Start:</strong> Begin raising horses in late spring (May) when the weather is milder, allowing for acclimation to outdoor conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Average Growth Time:</strong> Foals typically grow quickly and can be started under saddle around 2 to 3 years of age, depending on the breed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Winterizing Tips:</strong> Ensure that the barn is insulated and draft-free during winter. Provide extra bedding and consider using blankets for cold-sensitive horses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cold-Hardy Breeds:</strong> Choose breeds that can tolerate cold weather, such as the Norwegian Fjord or Appaloosa.</li>
