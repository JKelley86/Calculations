                <h2>How to Grow Apple Trees</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Apple trees prefer well-drained, fertile soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. Soil should be rich in organic matter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Apple trees require full sun for optimal growth, needing at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily.</li>
                    <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Young apple trees need regular watering, especially during dry periods. Mature trees are more drought-tolerant but benefit from deep watering during dry spells.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space trees 15 to 25 feet apart, depending on the rootstock and tree size.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pruning:</strong> Regular pruning helps maintain tree shape, encourages fruiting, and improves air circulation.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Specific Tips for Northern MN</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best Time to Plant:</strong> Plant apple trees in early spring (April to May) or in the fall (September to October) when the soil is workable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Average Growth Time:</strong> Apple trees typically begin to bear fruit in 3 to 5 years, depending on the variety.</li>
                    <li><strong>Winterizing Tips:</strong> Mulch around the base of the tree in the fall to protect the roots from freezing. Young trees can be wrapped with burlap to prevent frost damage and rodent activity. Ensure the tree is properly pruned before winter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Choosing Cold-Hardy Varieties:</strong> Select apple varieties that are suitable for colder climates, such as Honeycrisp, Haralson, and Zestar!, which can withstand northern Minnesota winters.</li>
                </ul>
