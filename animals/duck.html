                    <li><strong>Best Time to Start:</strong> Spring (April to May) is ideal for starting a duck flock, allowing them to acclimate before winter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Average Growth Time:</strong> Ducklings typically reach market weight in about 8 to 12 weeks, depending on the breed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Winterizing Tips:</strong> Provide insulated housing and bedding to keep ducks warm. Ensure they have access to fresh water, which may need to be heated to prevent freezing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cold-Hardy Breeds:</strong> Choose breeds like the Pekin or Khaki Campbell, which are well-suited for colder climates.</li>
