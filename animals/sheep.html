                <ul>
                    <li>Wool production for textiles and garments.</li>
                    <li>Meat production (lamb and mutton).</li>
                    <li>Milk production for cheese and other dairy products.</li>
                    <li>Land management through grazing, which helps maintain healthy pastures.</li>

                <h2>How to Raise Sheep</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Housing:</strong> Provide a clean, dry shelter that protects sheep from extreme weather, including wind and rain. Adequate ventilation is essential.</li>
                    <li><strong>Food:</strong> Sheep are herbivores that primarily eat grass, hay, and grains. Fresh water must always be available, along with minerals and salt licks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Ensure they have ample space to graze and roam, as exercise is crucial for their health.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Needs:</strong> Sheep are flock animals and should be kept in groups to prevent stress and loneliness.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Specific Tips for Northern MN</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best Time to Start:</strong> Late spring (May) is ideal for starting a sheep flock to help them adjust to their environment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Average Growth Time:</strong> Lambs typically reach market weight by 5 to 6 months of age, while they continue to grow until 1 year old.</li>
                    <li><strong>Winterizing Tips:</strong> Provide insulated shelters and plenty of bedding during winter. Ensure they have access to fresh water, which may need to be heated in freezing temperatures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cold-Hardy Breeds:</strong> Many sheep breeds are well-suited for colder climates, but care should be taken to monitor their health in extreme weather.</li>
                </ul>
